### Step 1

1. Download VirtualBox and install kali inside. You can find the instruction to do it here : https://github.com/NeverWonderLand/kali-inst-guide

2. Open a ROOT terminal (the red one in the kali menu). It is important that you update your system before installing anything :
```
apt update && apt upgrade -y
apt dist-upgrade -y
apt full-upgrade -y

# and then cleanup 

apt auroremove -y
```

### Step 2

1. Clone this repo :
```
git clone https://github.com/NeverWonderLand/Self-Way.git
```

2. Install it :
```
cd Self-Way
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

> To avoid to have to watch the screen the whole time, turn off the screen saver. To do this go in the kali menu and search for "power management" then turn it all off.

> Make a reboot when its finish by typing `reboot` in the terminal and press `ENTER`

</br>

### Step 2

Once all is complete:

* open the folder `Guide` on the Desktop
* right click inside the folder and choose `open a terminal here`
* in the terminal, type the command `glow` 

> Now you are in the Guide book! to navigate inside, use your arrow on the keyboard and select with `ENTER`. To exit just press `q`. You can always let this terminal open and then open a new one to make your work!

> To get start learning open the file `where_to_start.md`.
